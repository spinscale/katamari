# Katamari (å¡Š) Polyglot Asynchronous Web Server and Middleware Framework

Katamari is a Web Server and a Middleware Framework inspired by Rack (Ruby), Connect.js (Node.js), WSGI (Python) and Ring (Clojure). The asynchronous part is handled by [Netty](http://netty.io). And it is polyglot: written in Java with bindings for other languages (currently only Ruby).

It is a work in progress and many things will change. There will be more middlewares, enough to easily create a JSON API with authentication and the basic features needed for it. Middlewares will optionally be bound to routes. There will be bindings in Javascript, Clojure, Python, Scala and more.
